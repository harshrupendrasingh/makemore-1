# makemore-1
Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's makemore Part-1, this project builds a character-level language model using PyTorch. The model learns from a dataset of names and generates new names by predicting the next character based on a bigram model. It explores neural networks, probability distributions, and NLP fundamentals in a practical way.
